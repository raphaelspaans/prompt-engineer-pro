# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Architecture

This is a Plasmo browser extension project for prompt enhancement. The architecture follows the standard Plasmo framework structure:

- **popup.tsx**: Main popup interface component using React with TypeScript
- **manifest.json**: Auto-generated by Plasmo with host permissions for all HTTPS sites
- **build/**: Contains development and production builds for different browser targets

The extension is built with React 18 and TypeScript, using Plasmo's built-in build system and hot reload capabilities.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev

# Create production build
npm run build
# or 
pnpm build

# Package extension for distribution
npm run package
# or
pnpm package
```

## Development Workflow

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Load the extension from `build/chrome-mv3-dev` in Chrome developer mode
3. The popup auto-updates on code changes in `popup.tsx`
4. Add new pages by creating `options.tsx` (options page) or `content.ts` (content script) in the project root

## Browser Extension Structure

- Extension has broad host permissions (`https://*/*`) for web interaction
- Uses Manifest V3 format
- TypeScript configuration extends Plasmo's base template with path mapping (`~*` â†’ `./`)
